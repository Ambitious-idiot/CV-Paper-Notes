# README

There are notes for papers on CV in this repository. For each paper, both the note and the original paper are provided in the folder. Papers are in the areas below:

- Neural network structures: They are initially used for classification but popular now as backbone for downstream tasks, such as AlexNet, VGG, etc.

- Object detection: Mainly papers on two-stage detection now, such as the R-CNN series
- Generation: GAN, DIP, ...
- Style Transfer
- Anomaly detection (my current focus)

这个库存放了关于CV领域的论文笔记，每一篇笔记及其论文原文存放在同一目录下。这些论文涉及以下领域：

- 网络架构：这些结构最初用于图像分类问题，现在更多用于作为下游任务的骨干网络，如 AlexNet， VGG等
- 目标检测：主要为双阶段检测方法，比如R-CNN系列
- 生成问题：GAN，DIP，...
- 风格迁移
- 异常检测（我近期的关注方向）
